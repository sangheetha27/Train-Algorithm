# Train-Algorithm

This project was done by me under the supervision of Professor Xuequan. This Project focuses on the overall algorithm to operate the train system automatically and that can effectively scan specific biometric features of the passenger. It also has specific functionalities such as to calculate trip distances and number of passengers in the compartment.
